A side project, created because we wanted to watch some classic movies with a friend and we couldn't choose which one is going to be the next :P

Currently, the app is only fed with an array of the movies we want to watch. But I want to develop the idea and expand it so that every random user can benefit from it!

Additionally, I want to 'clean up' the code by simplyfing and using json data.
